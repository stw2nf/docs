### Recording Paths

Path recording allows for repeatable paths to be saved to the paths library for future use. Engage path recording by pressing the button on the homepage. When the recording is active, the vehicle is taking a GPS coordinate once every second, and saving that to the path. Proceed to send the vehicle on the desired path with manual control or following, then press Stop Recording when complete.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", gap: "64px", alignItems: "flex-start" }}>
    <Frame caption="Trigger Path Recording" style={{ padding: 0 }}>
    <img
        src="/images/mavcommander-engage-record-path.png"
        alt="Trigger Path Recording"
        width="200"
        style={{ display: "block" }}
    />
    </Frame>

    <Frame caption="Stop Path Recording" style={{ padding: 0 }}>
    <img
        src="/images/mavcommander-live-path.png"
        alt="Stop Path Recording"
        width="200"
        style={{ display: "block" }}
    />
    </Frame>
</div>

### Naming and Using Paths

The user will now be prompted to name the recorded path. After it is saved, the path will be accessible by pressing the arrow on the right hand side of the homepage. Paths from the library will appear here, and can be triggered with a simple press.

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", gap: "64px", alignItems: "flex-start" }}>
    <Frame caption="Naming the Path" style={{ padding: 0 }}>
    <img
        src="/images/mavcommander-name-path.png"
        alt="Naming the Path"
        width="200"
        style={{ display: "block" }}
    />
    </Frame>

    <Frame caption="Using Saved Paths" style={{ padding: 0 }}>
    <img
        src="/images/mavcommander-path-library.png"
        alt="Using Saved Paths"
        width="200"
        style={{ display: "block" }}
    />
    </Frame>
</div>
