    Mount the Base Station to the Tripod, and extend tripod to maximum height. The best environment for the base and rover antenna is a clear view of the sky that is 30 degrees above the horizon. Make sure that there are no obstacles around, such as buildings, trees, cars, and etc. 
    <Danger>Examples of a bad environments: indoors, urban area, forest, near the ground.</Danger>
    <Check>Examples of a good environments: Open spaces, peak of the mountains, roof of the buildings.</Check>
    Do not place the antenna near electronic devices, as high power electronic devices nearby may affect the radio frequency noise of GPS signal. Examples are mobile phone base stations, high voltage transformers, and etc. Please place the base station in an outdoor environment with sufficient sky coverage to obtain a good satellite signal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Power On">
    Insert the battery to the adapter, and power on the Base Station
    <Note>The 6 AH Battery included has a ~12 hour battery life before needing charge</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Do Not Move">
    Once the Base Station is powered on, it is crucial that the unit remains stationary. Moving the Base Station after it has begun operation will reduce accuracy of survey and the resulting correction data.
    <Note>In typical conditions, the survey should take 2-3 minutes to complete</Note>
