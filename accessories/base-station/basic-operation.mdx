**The RTK Base Station provides centimeter-level accurate GPS navigation for your PAL platform. It also facilitates the mesh network, allowing for many operators to control many PALs in the field. This manual outlines the steps of setup and operation of your Cyphra Base Station**

### Basic Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mount and Place Tripod">
    Mount the Base Station to the Tripod, and extend tripod to maximum height. Ensure that the tripod has a clear, unobstructed view of the horizon, and is not near any large buildings etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Power On">
    Insert the battery to the adapter, and power on the Base Station
    <Note>The 6 AH Battery included has a ~12 hour battery life before needing charge</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Do Not Move">
    Once the Base Station is powered on, it is crucial that the unit remains stationary. Moving the Base Station after it has begun operation will reduce accuracy of survey and the resulting correction data.
    <Note>In typical conditions, the survey should take 2-3mins to complete</Note>
