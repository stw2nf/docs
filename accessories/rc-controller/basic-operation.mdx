## Controller Pairing
Unlike the MavCommander App Interface, which can connect to an manually control any number of PALs, each physical RC Controller is paired, one - one, with a PAL. These can be configured and paired to different PALs, if desired. Please contact Cyphra before repairing RC Controllers, and our support team can walk you through the steps.

### Activate Button
Manual control requires the robot to be in MANUAL mode, and the robot to be activated (armed). To activate the robot, press down on the button on the back right of the controller. This will enable the joysticks for manual control. Releasing the button will deactivate the vehicle.

### Joystick Controls
Move the left hand, throttle stick, forward and back to control PAL in forward and reverse. Move the right hand, steering stick, right and left to turn.

### Charging
Charge controller with USB-C port on the bottom.
