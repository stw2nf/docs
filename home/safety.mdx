    - Always unplug the PAL from the wall or external charging station before turning the unit ON. Similarly, turn OFF the PAL before plugging it in to charge.
- **Screen Issues**:
    - **DO NOT** attempt to use the PAL if there are any issues with the screen (e.g., false touches, black screen, improper calibration). Consult a Cyphra representative for assistance.
- **Riding and Weight Restrictions**:
    - **DO NOT** ride, sit, or stand on top of the PAL.
- **Washing**:
    - **DO NOT** power wash the PAL or use a pressure washer.
- **Operating Environment**:
    - **DO NOT** operate the PAL near cliffs, ledges, or public roads.
    - **DO NOT** program the PAL to cross a public road.
    - **DO NOT** submerge the PAL in water or drive it into water deeper than 4 inches (10 centimeters).
- **Obstruction**:
    - **DO NOT** lie down or place objects in front of the PAL’s path.

### Emergency Procedures
